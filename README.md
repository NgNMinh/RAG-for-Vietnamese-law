RAG-based Legal Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for legal document retrieval and question answering in Vietnamese. The system loads legal documents, processes and embeds them, retrieves relevant contexts, and generates responses using a fine-tuned Vietnamese legal language model.

üöÄ RAG Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Documents: Import legal documents from a specified .docx file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Embedding & Storage: Process and embed the text using a multilingual embedding model for efficient retrieval.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Context Retrieval: Fetch relevant legal contexts from stored embeddings based on user queries.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Response Generation: Generate answers using the fine-tuned Vietnamese legal language model.

5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Reranking: Enhance retrieval accuracy using reranking methods.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Legal Documents: Ensure that the .docx file is correctly uploaded and the file path is set properly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the System: Execute the project by running RunAll in the app_RAG file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Interact with the Chatbot: Once execution is complete, a chatbot interface will appear. Simply ask a legal question, and the chatbot will process it to provide an answer.
